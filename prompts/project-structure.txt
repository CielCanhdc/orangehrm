1.1 Folder structure is organized by functionality:
   - `pom`: Contains Page Object Model components, organized into locators, base classes, page classes, and step definitions.
   - `tests`: Contains test cases for different modules.
   - `utils`: Contains utility functions for assertions, authentication, constants, logging, and screenshots.

1.2 Folder `pom` details:
   - `A_locators`: Contains locator definitions for different pages.
   - `B_bases`: Contains base classes for pages (base_page.py - wrap find_element methods) and tests (base_test.py - initial instance of Step classes).
   - `C_pages`: Contains page classes that implement page-specific actions.
   - `D_steps`: Contains step definitions that use page classes to perform actions in tests, step should include multiple small action within a screen in scenarios).
1.3 Test files in `tests` folder:
    - `test_login.py`: Contains test cases related to login functionality.
    - `test_PIM.py`: Contains test cases related to PIM (Personal Information Management) functionality.
1.4 Utility files in `utils` folder:
    - `assertion.py`: Custom assertion methods.
    - `auth.py`: Store cookies of previous session, load into current session to save the execution time.
    - `constant.py`: Constant values used across the framework.
    - `dummy.py`: Dummy data generation functions.
    - `logg.py`: Logging setup and functions, used as a decorator in every small step in C_pages and D_steps folder.
    - `screenshot.py`: Screenshot capture functions.
1.5 Configuration files:
    - `config.py`: Configuration settings for the project such as baseUrl, browsers, report type, wait time, etc.
    - `conftest.py`: Pytest fixtures and hooks such as init_driver, logging configuration, report hook.
    - `pytest.ini`: Pytest configuration file.


2. The ways to add a new test case into project
To add a new test case into the project, follow these steps:
Step 1: If new locators are needed, create a new file in the `pom/A_locators` folder or add to an existing locator file.
Step 2: If new page actions are needed, create a new file in the `pom/C_pages` folder or add to an existing page file.
Step 3: If new step definitions are needed, create a new file in the `pom/D_steps` folder or add to an existing step file.
Step 4: Create a new test file in the `tests` folder or add to an existing test file.
